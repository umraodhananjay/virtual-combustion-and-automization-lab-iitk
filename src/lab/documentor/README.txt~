	$$    ############ XAMPP installation procedure for LINUX ############
	
		--> Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Linux/

		--> Under the list of Browse Files for XAMPP click on 1.7.1 and under it click on xampp-linux-1.7.1.tar.gz to download the package.

		--> Once the package has been downloaded go to a Linux shell and login as the system administrator root: 
		    $ su

		--> Extract the downloaded archive file to /opt:
		    $ tar xvfz xampp-linux-1.7.1.tar.gz -C /opt

		Warning 1: Please use only this command to install XAMPP. DON'T use any Microsoft Windows tools to extract the archive, it won't work.
		Warning 2: already installed XAMPP versions get overwritten by this command.

		--> XAMPP is now installed below the /opt/lampp directory.

		--> To start XAMPP simply call this command:
		    $ /opt/lampp/lampp start

		--> You should now see something like this on your screen:

			Starting XAMPP 1.7.3a...
			LAMPP: Starting Apache...
			LAMPP: Starting MySQL...
			LAMPP started.
			Ready. Apache and MySQL are running

		--> To test go to the browser and type http://localhost and you should see the XAMPP page.

	$$ Extract and copy the documentor.tar.gz folder to the www or HTDOCS folder of your web server installation. (The precise
