## Preamble 

This package is developed as an independent module for documentation of experiments of the Virtual lab project. We are currently working on integrating this module into moodle, but encourage its use at this time as a standalone utility. 



## Installation of the documentation module ##

        

	@@@ Hardware Requirements @@@
		Disk space: 10MB free (min).
		Memory: 256MB (min), 1GB (recommended).


	@@@ Software Requirements @@@@ (latest versions)
		Web server - Apache2
		PHP5
		MySQL5


	#### Installing Apache, PHP and MySQL  (if required) ####

		This document will explain how to install Apache, PHP and Mysql in Ubuntu 10.04. The procedure on other Linux/MacOS/Win servers would be reasonably similar. For assistance, please contact Shahid/Sushanth (cc to me; email IDs provided at the bottom) 
		I'm running all the steps in this tutorial with root privileges, so make sure you're logged in as root: 
		Open the terminal and run following command
		sudo su
		Enter the sudo password

	####  Installing MySQL 5  ####

		First we install MySQL 5 like this:
		aptitude install mysql-server mysql-client
		You will be asked to provide a password for the MySQL root user - this password is valid for the user root@localhost as well as root@yourwebserver.com,
		so we don't have to specify a MySQL root password manually later on: 
		New password for the MySQL "root" user: <-- yourrootsqlpassword
		Repeat password for the MySQL "root" user: <-- yourrootsqlpassword


	####  Installing Apache2  ####
		Apache2 is available as an Ubuntu package, therefore we can install it as follows:
		aptitude install apache2
		Now direct your browser to http://localhost, and you should see the Apache2 placeholder page (It works!): 
		Apache's default document root is /var/www on Ubuntu, and the configuration file is /etc/apache2/apache2.conf. 
		Additional configurations are stored in subdirectories of the /etc/apache2 directory such as /etc/apache2/mods-enabled (for Apache modules), 
                /etc/apache2/sites-enabled (for virtual hosts), and /etc/apache2/conf.d.
		Installing PHP5
		We can install PHP5 and the Apache PHP5 module as follows:
		aptitude install php5 libapache2-mod-php5
		We must restart Apache afterwards:
		/etc/init.d/apache2 restart



	$$ Extract and copy the documentor.tar.gz folder to the www or HTDOCS folder of your web server installation. (The precise
	path would depend on your web server)

	$$ Run the mysql.sql file to setup the database on Mysql

	$$ Enter the configuration details in the config.inc.php file.

	$$ To open the control panel page type http://localhost/documentor/mod_form.php on your web browser

Using the Top Menu:-
There is a file named blank.php supplied with other. whenever a new top menu tab is added, the caption is also given a link under it. This link has a xxx.php file under it where 
the user is redirected when he clicks on tht link. for example, when a user clicks on home top menu tab, he is sent to blank.php. this php is blank & the information for home page can be added here. similarly whenever a new top menu tab is added,
the user has to create a new XXX.php naming it according to the link given under the tab while creating it. this php code for the file can be copied from blank.php
